## Files Modified This Session

### Services/LinkedInScraper.cs (Major Enhancements)
- **CleanLessonTitle() Method**: Removes status indicators and duration text using regex patterns
  - Patterns: "(In progress)", "(Viewed)", "3m 4s video", "4m 15s video", etc.
  - Whitespace normalization and cleanup
- **CleanInstructorName() Method**: Removes LinkedIn profile link text patterns
  - Removes: "Go to LinkedIn Profile", "View Profile", "LinkedIn Profile", "Profile"
- **Enhanced Instructor Extraction**: Improved selectors with title attribute checking and better error handling
- **Applied Title Cleaning**: Clean titles applied immediately after `TextContentAsync()` extraction

### Services/MarkdownGenerator.cs (Simplified Structure)
- **Removed Navigation Generation**: Eliminated `BuildLessonNavigation()` method entirely
- **Simplified Lesson Files**: Clean structure with only essential metadata and transcript
- **Removed Footer Navigation**: No more navigation sections in lesson files
- **Clean Enhanced Files**: Updated enhanced lesson generation to remove navigation

## Issues Resolved

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Dirty Lesson Titles
- **Problem**: Titles contained "(In progress)", "(Viewed)", "3m 4s video" status and duration text
- **Root Cause**: Raw `TextContentAsync()` extraction included all UI text elements
- **Solution**: Added `CleanLessonTitle()` with comprehensive regex pattern cleaning
- **Result**: Clean titles like "What exactly is an agent?" instead of "What exactly is an agent? (In progress) 3m 4s video"

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL: Instructor Extraction Issues  
- **Problem**: Instructor field showing "Go to LinkedIn Profile" instead of actual names
- **Root Cause**: Selectors targeting profile links rather than instructor names
- **Solution**: Enhanced selectors with title attribute checking and text cleaning
- **Result**: Better instructor extraction with fallback to "Unknown Instructor" when needed

### ðŸŸ¡ Navigation Clutter
- **Problem**: Excessive navigation links cluttering lesson files
- **User Request**: Keep only essential metadata (Course, Instructor, Lesson, Extracted, Transcript)
- **Solution**: Completely removed all navigation generation
- **Result**: Clean, minimal lesson files focused on content
