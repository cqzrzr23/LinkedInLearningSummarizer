## Overview
Fixed a critical navigation attempt counter display issue that was confusing users during transcript extraction. The system was showing misleading "Attempt 1/3" messages for retry attempts instead of properly incrementing to "Attempt 2/3", "Attempt 3/3", etc.

## Key Accomplishments

### Navigation Counter Logic Fix
- **Identified Root Cause**: NavigateToLessonAsync had its own retry loop that always reset to attempt=1, even when called from the 2nd or 3rd overall extraction attempt
- **Restructured Retry Architecture**: Moved navigation strategy selection from NavigateToLessonAsync up to ExtractLessonTranscriptAsync for unified attempt management
- **Progressive Strategy Implementation**: Each attempt now uses a different navigation strategy:
  - Attempt 1: NetworkIdle (60s timeout)
  - Attempt 2: DOMContentLoaded (45s timeout)  
  - Attempt 3: Load (30s timeout)

### Code Architecture Improvements
- **Simplified NavigateToLessonAsync**: Now handles single navigation attempts with specific strategy parameters rather than managing its own retry loop
- **Unified Counter Management**: ExtractLessonTranscriptAsync now manages both overall attempts AND navigation strategy selection in one cohesive system
- **Clear Console Output**: Users now see proper attempt progression: "Attempt 1/3" ’ "Attempt 2/3" ’ "Attempt 3/3"

## Files Modified 

### Services/LinkedInScraper.cs
- **NavigateToLessonAsync method**: 
  - Changed signature from `NavigateToLessonAsync(string lessonUrl, int overallAttempt = 1)` to `NavigateToLessonAsync(string lessonUrl, WaitUntilState waitUntil, int timeout, string strategyName, int attempt, int maxRetries)`
  - Removed internal retry loop and strategy selection logic
  - Simplified to handle only single navigation attempts with provided strategy
- **ExtractLessonTranscriptAsync method**:
  - Added waitStrategies array definition
  - Implemented unified attempt counter management
  - Added strategy selection logic that progresses through different navigation approaches
  - Updated method calls to pass specific strategy parameters to NavigateToLessonAsync

## Issues Resolved

### Critical Navigation Display Bug
- **Before**: Users saw confusing duplicate "Attempt 1/3" messages
- **After**: Users see clear attempt progression with different strategies per attempt
- **Impact**: Eliminates user confusion during transcript extraction process and provides better insight into system behavior

### Architecture Improvement
- **Before**: Split responsibility between two methods with conflicting retry logic
- **After**: Clean separation of concerns with unified attempt management
- **Impact**: More maintainable code and consistent user experience

## Next Steps

### Immediate Testing
- Test the fixed navigation counter with actual lesson extraction to verify correct display
- Validate that each attempt properly uses different navigation strategies
- Confirm retry delays and error handling still work correctly

### Development Continuation  
- Continue with **Phase 5: Multi-Course Processing** (Week 9 tasks)
- Implement `urls.txt` file reading and parsing for batch processing
- Add progress tracking across multiple courses

### Quality Assurance
- Monitor system behavior with various course types to ensure navigation reliability
- Test edge cases where all three navigation strategies might fail
- Validate error messages provide clear debugging information

## Git Commit Message
```
Fix navigation attempt counter display issue

- Restructure retry logic to show correct attempt progression (1/3 ’ 2/3 ’ 3/3)
- Move navigation strategy selection from NavigateToLessonAsync to ExtractLessonTranscriptAsync
- Implement progressive navigation strategies (NetworkIdle ’ DOMContentLoaded ’ Load)  
- Simplify NavigateToLessonAsync to handle single attempts with specific strategies
- Eliminate confusing duplicate "Attempt 1/3" console messages
