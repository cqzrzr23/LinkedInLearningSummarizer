# Session 2025-08-17

## Overview
Focused debugging session to resolve critical test isolation issues that were preventing the solution from building successfully. Fixed comprehensive unit test infrastructure.

## Key Accomplishments
- ✅ Resolved test isolation issues preventing build success
- ✅ Fixed all 31 unit tests to prevent real .env file interference
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive environment variable clearing in test setup/teardown
- ✅ Added explicit file path specifications in tests to ensure isolation
- ✅ Achieved 100% test pass rate (31/31 tests passing)
- ✅ Verified automatic test execution integration with MSBuild works correctly
- ✅ Upgraded project from .NET 6.0 to .NET 8.0 as requested

## Files Modified
- **Tests/ConfigurationServiceTests.cs** - Added `ClearAllEnvironmentVariables()` method and calls
- **Tests/ConfigurationServiceTests.cs** - Modified all test methods to use explicit non-existent file paths
- **Services/ConfigurationService.cs** - Updated comment about DotNetEnv behavior
- **LinkedInLearningSummarizer.csproj** - Updated to .NET 8.0 target framework
- **Tests/Tests.csproj** - Updated to .NET 8.0 target framework

## Issues Resolved
- **Critical Build Failure**: 11 failing tests due to real .env values overriding test environment variables
- **Test Isolation**: Real .env file (HEADLESS=true, MAX_SCROLL_ROUNDS=15) was interfering with test scenarios
- **DotNetEnv Loading**: Tests that created ConfigurationService without explicit paths were accidentally loading real configuration
- **Environment Variable Contamination**: Tests weren't properly clearing environment state between runs
- **MSBuild Integration**: Confirmed automatic test execution works correctly after fixes

## Next Steps
Foundation and testing infrastructure now complete. Ready to proceed with:
1. Implement LinkedIn Session Management with Playwright
2. Create browser automation for first-run authentication
3. Build session persistence to SESSION_PROFILE
4. Add session validation and expiration detection
