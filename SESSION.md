# Session 2025-08-24

## Overview
Fixed a critical bug where lesson file numbering was incorrect when some lessons failed to extract transcripts. The issue caused subsequent lessons to have wrong file numbers (e.g., lesson 10 saved as "09-..." when lesson 9 failed).

## Key Accomplishments
- Fixed lesson file numbering to use actual lesson numbers instead of sequential indices
- Ensured consistent file naming across all markdown generation methods
- Maintained proper linking between README and individual lesson files

## Files Modified
- **Services/MarkdownGenerator.cs**: Updated three methods to use `lesson.LessonNumber` instead of sequential index:
  - `GenerateLessonFileAsync` (line 192)
  - `GenerateCourseReadmeAsync` (line 267)
  - `GenerateFullTranscriptAsync` (line 463)

## Issues Resolved
- **Incorrect lesson numbering**: When a lesson failed to extract (like lesson 9), subsequent lessons were numbered incorrectly in the output files
- **Broken table of contents links**: Links in README.md now correctly point to files with proper lesson numbers
- **File naming consistency**: All generated files now use the actual lesson number from the course structure

## Next Steps
- Monitor the application during next run to verify correct file numbering
- Consider adding unit tests to verify file naming logic
- No pending items from this session

## Git Commit Message
Fix lesson file numbering when transcript extraction fails

- Use actual lesson.LessonNumber instead of sequential index for file naming
- Ensures correct numbering even when some lessons have no transcripts
- Fixes broken links in README.md table of contents
