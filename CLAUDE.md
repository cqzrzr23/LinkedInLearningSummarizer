- Use `DotNetEnv.Env.Load()` to load .env file
- Validate all required environment variables on startup
- Fail fast with clear error messages for missing config
- No interactive prompts during processing

## Core Functionality Requirements

### 1. LinkedIn Session Management
**First Run Behavior:**
- Detect if SESSION_PROFILE exists
- If not found, launch browser in headed mode (ignore HEADLESS setting)
- Navigate to LinkedIn login page
- Wait for user to complete manual login (including 2FA)
- Save session cookies/state to SESSION_PROFILE file
- Display success message to user

**Subsequent Runs:**
- Load session from SESSION_PROFILE
- Use HEADLESS setting for browser mode
- Validate session is still active before processing
- If session expired, repeat first-run flow

### 2. Transcript Extraction Process
**Course Processing:**
- Navigate to each course URL from urls.txt
- Extract course metadata (title, instructor, total lessons)
- Iterate through all lessons in the course
- For each lesson:
  - Navigate to lesson page
  - Find and expand transcript section
  - Handle dynamic content loading (use MAX_SCROLL_ROUNDS)
  - Extract transcript text
  - Optionally preserve timestamps based on KEEP_TIMESTAMPS
  - Save lesson data to memory

**Error Handling:**
- Retry failed extractions with exponential backoff
- Log detailed error information
- Continue processing other lessons if one fails
- Generate partial results when possible

### 3. Markdown Generation
**File Structure:**
```
output/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ course-name-sanitized/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # Course overview + AI summary
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lessons/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01-lesson-name.md
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02-lesson-name.md
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ full-transcript.md          # Complete course transcript
```

**Markdown Content Requirements:**
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 for course, H2 for lessons)
- Include lesson metadata (duration, instructor, lesson number)
- Generate table of contents with navigation links
- Sanitize filenames for cross-platform compatibility
- Include course metadata at the top of each file

### 4. AI Summarization
**OpenAI Integration:**
- Use configured OPENAI_MODEL (default: gpt-4o-mini)
- Load custom prompt template from SUMMARY_INSTRUCTION_PATH
- Handle long transcripts with chunking (MAP_CHUNK_SIZE and MAP_CHUNK_OVERLAP)
- Implement map-reduce pattern for large courses
- Generate summaries according to user-defined instructions

**Custom AI Instructions:**
- Load instruction content from file specified in SUMMARY_INSTRUCTION_PATH
- If file doesn't exist, use default summarization prompt
- Support markdown format for instruction files
- Pass loaded instructions as system prompt to OpenAI API
- Allow users complete flexibility in defining summary format and style

**Example Instruction File (Instructions.md):**
```markdown

## Important Instructions for Claude

Always follow these steps when working on this project:

1. **Start of Every Conversation**: Read PLANNING.md to understand the project vision, architecture, and current phase
2. **Before Starting Work**: Check TASKS.md to see what needs to be done and what's already completed, and check SESSION.md for important notes and context from previous sessions
3. **After Completing Work**: Mark completed tasks with [x] in TASKS.md immediately
4. **During Development**: Add any newly discovered tasks to TASKS.md under the appropriate milestone

This ensures continuity across conversations and maintains accurate project tracking.

## Task Progress Tracking

### After Completing Any Tasks
When you complete tasks from TASKS.md, you MUST update the progress summary at the end of the file, but ALWAYS ask for user permission first:

1. **Ask Permission**: "Should I update the TASKS.md progress summary with the latest completion counts?"
2. **Count Completed Tasks**: Use `grep -c "- \[x\]" TASKS.md` to count completed tasks
3. **Count Total Tasks**: Use `grep -c "- \[" TASKS.md` to count all tasks  
4. **Update Summary Section** at the end of TASKS.md (only after user approval):
   ```
   *Last Updated: [Current Date]*
   *Total Tasks: [Total Count]*
   *Completed: [Completed Count]*
   *In Progress: [Count of ﬂö tasks]*
   *Blocked: [Count of ‚ö†Ô∏è tasks]*
   ```

### Task Status Conventions
- `[x]` = Completed task
- `[ ]` = Incomplete task  
- `ﬂö` = In progress (mark in task content)
- `‚ö†Ô∏è` = Blocked (mark in task content)

### When to Update
- After marking any tasks as complete
- At the end of each development session
- When major milestones are reached

**IMPORTANT**: Never update the progress summary without explicit user permission. Always ask first.

This ensures accurate project progress tracking across all conversations while respecting user control.
