   On macOS/Linux:
   ```bash
   ./bin/Debug/net6.0/playwright.sh install
   ```

4. **Configure environment**
   
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update with your settings:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` file:
   ```env
   # Required: Your OpenAI API key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
   
   # Optional: Customize other settings as needed
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   OUTPUT_TRANSCRIPT_DIR=./output
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Create a URL list file** (e.g., `urls.txt`)
   ```
   https://www.linkedin.com/learning/course-name-1
   https://www.linkedin.com/learning/course-name-2
   # Comments are supported
   ```

2. **Run the summarizer**
   ```bash
   dotnet run urls.txt
   ```

3. **First-time authentication**
   - On first run, a browser window will open
   - Log into LinkedIn Learning manually
   - The session will be saved for future use

### Commands

```bash
# Process courses from URL file
dotnet run urls.txt

# Check configuration
dotnet run -- --check-config

# Reset LinkedIn session
dotnet run -- --reset-session

# Show help
dotnet run -- --help
```

## Configuration Options

All configuration options can be set via environment variables or `.env` file:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | (required) | Your OpenAI API key |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | `gpt-4o-mini` | OpenAI model to use |
| `OUTPUT_TRANSCRIPT_DIR` | `./output` | Directory for output files |
| `SESSION_PROFILE` | `linkedin_session` | Browser session profile name |
| `HEADLESS` | `true` | Run browser in headless mode |
| `KEEP_TIMESTAMPS` | `false` | Preserve timestamps in transcripts |
| `MAX_SCROLL_ROUNDS` | `10` | Max scroll attempts for loading content |
| `SINGLE_PASS_THRESHOLD` | `5000` | Character threshold for single-pass processing |
| `MAP_CHUNK_SIZE` | `4000` | Token chunk size for AI processing |
| `MAP_CHUNK_OVERLAP` | `200` | Overlap between chunks |
| `SUMMARY_INSTRUCTION_PATH` | `./prompts/summary.txt` | Custom AI instruction file |

## Output Structure

```

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ course-name/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Course overview with AI summary
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lessons/

```

## Custom AI Instructions

To customize how summaries are generated, create a file at `./prompts/summary.txt` with your instructions. The AI will use these instructions when generating summaries.

## Security Notes

- **Never commit your `.env` file** - It contains sensitive API keys
- API keys are masked in console output for security
- Browser sessions are stored locally and should not be shared

## Troubleshooting

### "OPENAI_API_KEY is required" error
- Ensure your `.env` file exists and contains a valid OpenAI API key
- Check that the key starts with `sk-`

### Browser doesn't open for login
- Ensure Playwright browsers are installed: `pwsh bin/Debug/net6.0/playwright.ps1 install`
- Try resetting the session: `dotnet run -- --reset-session`

### Transcript extraction fails
- Verify you have access to the course on LinkedIn Learning
- Check that your session is still valid
- Some courses may not have transcripts available
